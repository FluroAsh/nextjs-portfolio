# [Ashleys' Portfolio Website](http://ashleygthompson.com)

A portfolio website designed to utilise industry relevant such as `NextJS` and `GraphQL`, and to showcase my evergrowing knowledge of Backend and Frontend concepts, best practices, and even have a bit of fun! üë®‚Äçüé®

## ü•∏ Before You Start...
### Node Version
[Strapi](https://docs.strapi.io/developer-docs/latest/setup-deployment-guides/installation/cli.html) only supports up to Node `v18` currently, so you'll need to stick with what has been specified in the respective `.nvmrc` files for both **Backend** and **Frontend** ‚Äî at the moment both are using `lts/hydrogen`.

If you're using [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) and already have `lts/hydrogen` installed then you can navigate to the respective directory and select it using `nvm use`. 

Otherwise, you'll need to install this version of Node manualy from the [Node website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/releases/), or via [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) with `nvm install lts/hydrogen`.

Once you're done with that, navigate to Respective Directory (FE/BE) for a detailed overview of setting up your **local dev environment**.
